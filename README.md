# Daily Scrum Picker

[![Build and publish container image](https://github.com/rm3l/daily-scrum-picker/actions/workflows/build-and-publish-container-image.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rm3l/daily-scrum-picker/actions/workflows/build-and-publish-container-image.yaml)

A simple Go utility to fairly select the next person to speak during daily scrum/stand-up meetings.

**NOTE**: Assisted by AI as a quick experiment to get something up and running in a few minutes.

## Overview

This tool ensures fair rotation of team members during daily stand-ups by automatically tracking who has spoken and resetting when everyone has had a turn.

**Features:**

1. **Fair Rotation**: Tracks who hasn't spoken yet automatically
2. **Random Shuffling**: When everyone has had a turn, shuffles the team list for the next cycle
3. **Persistent Tracking**: Remembers selections between runs so you can use it daily
4. **Automatic Reset**: When the list is empty, automatically starts a new randomized cycle

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rm3l/daily-scrum-picker.git && cd daily-scrum-picker
```

## Usage

### Local Development

1. Create a local `team.txt` file containing the names of your team members. See [Team members](#team-members) for more details.

2. Simply run with Go:

```bash
go run pick_next.go
```

Alternatively, you can build and run the executable:

```bash
go build -o daily-scrum-picker pick_next.go
./daily-scrum-picker
```

You can also specify a custom team file using the `--team-file` (or `-t`) flag:

```bash
go run pick_next.go --team-file=/path/to/my-team.txt
go run pick_next.go -t /path/to/my-team.txt
./daily-scrum-picker --team-file=teams/backend.txt
./daily-scrum-picker -t teams/backend.txt
```

### Container Usage

This tool is also available as a container image on ghcr.io. This allows you to use the tool without cloning the repository or installing Go.

It runs in interactive mode with **single-keypress commands** - no need to press Enter:

```bash
# Mount your custom team file
podman run -it --rm \
  -v ./my-team.txt:/app/team.txt \
  ghcr.io/rm3l/daily-scrum-picker:main

# Or use a different file path with environment variable
podman run -it --rm \
  -v ./teams:/app/teams \
  -e TEAM_FILE=teams/backend.txt \
  ghcr.io/rm3l/daily-scrum-picker:main
```

### Interactive Mode

**Available commands (single keypress):**

- **`p`** - Pick the next person for daily scrum
- **`r`** - Reset and start over with all team members  
- **`s`** - Show current status and remaining team members
- **`h`** - Show help message
- **`q`** - Exit the program

**Notes:** 

- Use the `-it` flags to enable interactive mode with proper terminal support
- Commands respond immediately without pressing Enter
- Fallback to Enter-required mode if raw terminal access is unavailable

### Output Examples

**Interactive session:**

```txt
=== Daily Scrum Picker ===
Team file: team.txt (6 members)

Commands:
  p - Pick next person
  r - Reset and start over
  s - Show current status
  h - Show this help
  q - Quit

Press any key (no Enter needed):
> p
ðŸŽ¯ Next is... Alice
(5 people remaining in this round)

> p
ðŸŽ¯ Next is... Charlie
(4 people remaining in this round)

> s
ðŸ“Š Status:
  Total team members: 6
  Remaining this round: 4
  Still to pick: Bob, Diana, Frank, Grace

> q
Goodbye!
```

## Configuration

### Team Members

Team members are configured via a team file. By default, the tool looks for `team.txt` in the same directory where it is run, but you can specify a different file using either:

1. The `--team-file` (or `-t`) command-line flag
2. The `TEAM_FILE` environment variable

Create or edit the team file with one team member name per line:

```txt
# Daily Scrum Team Members
# Add one team member name per line
# Lines starting with # are ignored

Alice
Bob
Charlie
Diana
```

#### Configuration Options

The tool supports multiple ways to specify the team file (in order of precedence):

| Method | Description | Priority |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `--team-file` / `-t` flag | Path to team members file | **Highest** (overrides environment variable) |
| `TEAM_FILE` environment variable | Path to team members file | Medium |
| Default | Uses `team.txt` in current directory | Lowest |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Using command-line flag (long form)
go run pick_next.go --team-file="/path/to/my-team.txt"
./daily-scrum-picker --team-file="teams/backend.txt"

# Using command-line flag (short form)
go run pick_next.go -t "/path/to/my-team.txt"
./daily-scrum-picker -t "teams/backend.txt"

# Using environment variable
export TEAM_FILE="/path/to/my-team.txt"
go run pick_next.go

# Environment variable for single run
TEAM_FILE="/path/to/teams/backend-team.txt" go run pick_next.go

# Command-line flag takes precedence over environment variable
TEAM_FILE="/path/to/env-team.txt" go run pick_next.go -t "/path/to/flag-team.txt"
# Will use /path/to/flag-team.txt (flag overrides environment variable)

# Container usage with environment variable
podman run -it --rm \
  -v ./teams:/app/teams \
  -e TEAM_FILE=teams/backend.txt \
  ghcr.io/rm3l/daily-scrum-picker:main

# Container usage with custom team file mounted
podman run -it --rm \
  -v ./my-team.txt:/app/team.txt \
  ghcr.io/rm3l/daily-scrum-picker:main -t /app/team.txt
```
